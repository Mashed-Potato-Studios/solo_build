# Reporter Component

The Reporter component is responsible for generating reports about the build process, including code analysis, build statistics, and other useful information.

## Overview

The Reporter takes the results of the build process, including analysis results, and generates reports in various formats. These reports can be used to track code quality, identify issues, and monitor build performance.

## API

### Constructor

```typescript
constructor(config: BuildConfig)
```

Creates a new Reporter instance with the specified configuration.

#### Parameters

- `config`: The build configuration object

### Methods

#### generateReports

```typescript
async generateReports(result: BuildResult): Promise<Report[]>
```

Generates reports based on the build result.

##### Parameters

- `result`: The result of the build process

##### Returns

A promise that resolves to an array of Report objects

#### generateComplexityReport

```typescript
generateComplexityReport(analysis: AnalysisResult): Report
```

Generates a report about code complexity.

##### Parameters

- `analysis`: The result of code analysis

##### Returns

A Report object containing complexity information

#### generateIssuesReport

```typescript
generateIssuesReport(analysis: AnalysisResult): Report
```

Generates a report about code issues.

##### Parameters

- `analysis`: The result of code analysis

##### Returns

A Report object containing issue information

#### generateDependenciesReport

```typescript
generateDependenciesReport(analysis: AnalysisResult): Report
```

Generates a report about code dependencies.

##### Parameters

- `analysis`: The result of code analysis

##### Returns

A Report object containing dependency information

#### writeReport

```typescript
async writeReport(report: Report): Promise<void>
```

Writes a report to disk.

##### Parameters

- `report`: The report to write

## Configuration

The Reporter component uses the following configuration options:

- `reports.enabled`: Whether to generate reports
- `reports.formats`: The formats to generate reports in (json, html, markdown)
- `reports.outputDir`: The directory to output reports to
- `reports.types`: The types of reports to generate (complexity, issues, dependencies)

## Example Usage

```typescript
import { Reporter } from './reporter';
import { BuildConfig } from '../types';
import { build } from './index';

// Create a configuration
const config: BuildConfig = {
  // ... other config options
  reports: {
    enabled: true,
    formats: ['json', 'html'],
    outputDir: 'reports',
    types: ['complexity', 'issues', 'dependencies']
  }
};

// Run the build
const result = await build(config);

// Generate reports
const reporter = new Reporter(config);
const reports = await reporter.generateReports(result);

console.log(`Generated ${reports.length} reports`);
```

## Report Types

The Reporter can generate various types of reports:

### Complexity Report

The complexity report provides information about the complexity of the codebase, including:

- Cyclomatic complexity of functions
- Nesting depth of control structures
- Lines of code per file
- Number of functions and classes

### Issues Report

The issues report provides information about issues found in the codebase, including:

- Syntax issues
- Semantic issues
- Style issues
- Performance issues
- Security issues
- Maintainability issues

### Dependencies Report

The dependencies report provides information about dependencies in the codebase, including:

- Import/export relationships between files
- External dependencies
- Unused dependencies
- Circular dependencies

## Report Formats

The Reporter can generate reports in various formats:

### JSON

JSON reports are machine-readable and can be easily processed by other tools.

### HTML

HTML reports are human-readable and can be viewed in a web browser. They include visualizations and interactive elements.

### Markdown

Markdown reports are human-readable and can be viewed in a text editor or rendered as HTML.

## Implementation Details

The Reporter uses various techniques to generate reports:

1. **Data Collection**: Collects data from the build result and analysis result
2. **Data Processing**: Processes the data to extract useful information
3. **Report Generation**: Generates reports in the specified formats
4. **Report Writing**: Writes reports to disk

## Performance Considerations

- Report generation can be CPU and memory-intensive for large codebases
- HTML reports with visualizations can be particularly resource-intensive
- Reports are generated in parallel for better performance

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more report types
- Improve HTML report visualizations
- Add support for custom report templates
- Add support for report comparison (e.g., comparing reports from different builds)
