# Solo Build Documentation

Welcome to the Solo Build documentation. Solo Build is an AI-powered build system designed for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

## Core Components

Solo Build consists of several core components that work together to provide a comprehensive build system:

- [Parser](/docs/parser): Transforms source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- [Analyzer](/docs/analyzer): Analyzes code for complexity, dependencies, and issues
- [Transformer](/docs/transformer): Modifies code based on analysis results and optimization rules
- [Generator](/docs/generator): Produces output files from transformed ASTs
- [Workflow Engine](/docs/workflow): Orchestrates the build process through configurable workflows
- [Task Runner](/docs/task-runner): Executes build tasks with robust error handling and monitoring

## Getting Started

If you're new to Solo Build, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide, which will walk you through the installation process and basic usage.

## Key Features

- **Framework/Language Detection**: Automatically detects and configures for different frameworks and languages
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Provides insights and optimization suggestions using AI
- **Workflow Templates**: Includes pre-configured workflow templates for common scenarios
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Supports custom plugins for transformations and analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements caching and parallel processing for speed

## Command Line Interface

Solo Build provides a powerful CLI for interacting with the build system:

- `solo init`: Initialize a new project
- `solo run`: Run the build process
- `solo analyze`: Analyze code architecture
- `solo workflow`: Manage workflows

## CLI Commands

- [Run](/docs/cli-run) - Execute the build process
- [Init](/docs/cli-init) - Create a new Solo Build project
- [Analyze](/docs/cli-analyze) - Analyze code and generate reports
- [Report](/docs/cli-report) - Manage and view generated reports
- [Workflow](/docs/cli-workflow) - Manage workflows
